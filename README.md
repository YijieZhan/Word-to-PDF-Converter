User-friendly GUI for easy interaction.
Error handling for graceful failure reporting.
Modern theming for the application window using ThemedStyle.
File menu for opening Word documents and exiting the application.
Status bar at the bottom for displaying messages.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
The comtypes library for Python. You can install it using pip:
